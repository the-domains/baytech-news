description: Discovering new places should always be fun as should adding new courses to your running routes. I love to run and regularly go for a gentle 10 – 15 k run on Sunday mornings with a mate. I say gentle as the goal is to cruise along a course having a chat and stopping once or twice for a stretch and some water. The 6 am Sunday morning run is not race time or excess endurance running.
