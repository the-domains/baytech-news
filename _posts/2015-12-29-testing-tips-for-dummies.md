# Testing tips for dummies!

By Vedavyas Konidena

When starting a career in testing, either with or without prior knowledge/experience in development, I think the following become the essential qualities to build a successful career. Creating test plans, managing and implementing test plans, regression testing, load testing will become part of the process.

The following is assuming you already have a basic understanding of the testing processes and activities.

**Understand the Process**

Understand the processes at a high level for the industry that would start testing in. For example, if you were to start testing on a procurement application get a certain level of understanding of what is involved in procurement cycle. i.e. who is involved, what are the different activities, where does the process start and end.

This will not only help clarify what is being discussed in team meetings with the business analysts, but will also enable you to put forth questions/scenarios that the Business Analysts may have missed. Knowing this will give you a definite scope/boundary for the process that needs to be tested.

Understand how the Application implements the Process

Once you have a fair bit of understanding of the process that needs to be implemented, it is time that you understand how the process is implemented in the Application/product being implemented. Interact with the business analysts and developers from the design stages so that, you know how a process is mapped in the application to a certain extent.

Beware, that the design and actual implementation might change during course of development, so have frequent meetings/discussions on design and implementation of the product. This will give you an idea of how to start setting up your test cases.

**Understand how the user intends to use the Application**

You now know the process and how it is being implemented, is this enough? I would say no.

It is very essential to understand or at the least get a basic idea of how the user intends to use the application. Although business analysts and the developers also need to consider this as the one of the key criteria for successful implementation of applications, it also the duty of testers to think like a user. If it is not tested in that scope, no amount of testing (or any additional testing) would prove to be unworthy. If it is not easy to use, shoot it back to the development team; if it does not work the way the user intends to use it, shoot it back to the development team.

In the end, it is the end users who determine the success of an application development/product implementation.
