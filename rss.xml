            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Post - Bay Technologies - A Secure Future - MINCOR - CIRAM</h1><p>Whenever I talked to someone about returning to work, they just looked at me like "Oh no... Poor baby has to go to childcare"... Not really what you want to hear! But I knew it was the best decision not only for me and my husband but also for our baby.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/eaeff81fc66f18f83585b9011abc5a7c365700d9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Bush Running – Planning the event]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bush Running – Planning the event</h1><p>Discovering new places should always be fun as should adding new courses to your running routes. I love to run and regularly go for a gentle 10 – 15 k run on Sunday mornings with a mate. I say gentle as the goal is to cruise along a course having a chat and stopping once or twice for a stretch and some water. The 6 am Sunday morning run is not race time or excess endurance running.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/39bec272ff6486bf203ba3c9f3c9e13467db45b9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to motivate people!</h1><p>Often times in the business world, science takes a back seat to tradition. Management tells the workers what to do, how to do it, what happens if they don't do it and puts a carrot on a stick and sits back and watches the show. If your company is driven by manual labour and you have implemented this, you my friend, are a genius.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2b395d89569129d9aa4af449222556ea90bf342e.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Shared Government Services </h1><p>While there have been some successes with shared services solutions (particularly in Canada), attempts to implement such solutions have experienced difficulties in jurisdictions other than Queensland. The Public Services International Research Unit of the University of Greenwich (UK) published a report in 2014 titled "Shared Services - Setting unrealistic expectations" which examined the UK experience.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8793bda289e36e944fe51d783403d8f3/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=383&cropwidth=740&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F6225724253fc127f1095e68efd19986f3face272.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
